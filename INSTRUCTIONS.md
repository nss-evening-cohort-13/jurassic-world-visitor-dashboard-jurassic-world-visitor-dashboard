## Mentor
Abbey

## Project Requirements
- Clean code - single responsibility principle
- ES6 Modules bundled with webpack
- No errors - linters should be clean
- Jquery for any DOM manipulation (selectors, modifying css classes, events)
- SASS and Bootstrap for styling
- Completely planned out - before each section you should be making new cards before you code. You should have wireframes and an ERD

## Planning and Setup
For planning and setup, your team will need to divide and conquer. All of these items will need to be completed and reviewed by noon on Saturday.
- Create an ERD and add to Readme
- Create Wireframes on Figma and add to Readme

## Setup:
Create a setup branch and setup webpack (make a ticket for this first)
- Issue Ticket Template
- Pull request Template
- Set up readme

## Create 2 branches: Main and Development
- Protect the Main branch from merging (DO NOT MERGE TO MAIN UNTIL APPROVAL FROM YOUR MENTOR IS OBTAINED)
- All development should be done on the Development branch
- When a milestone is completed, make a PR against the Main branch for your mentor to review.
- DO NOT move on to another milestone until everyone on your team is completed with the milestone AND you get approval from your mentor.
- Create a new firebase project and enable google authentication
- Share API keys with team (DO NOT PUSH TO GITHUB)
- One person run deploys

## Expectations
- Break each section below into milestones
- Deploy each milestone
- Deployed URL on Readme

Create a PR against the Main branch with:
- The tickets completed that sprint
- Explanation of what was completed in the sprint

## Week 2

### Description
After the first group of developers mysteriously disappeared in a freak accident (conveniently right before the checks cleared), you'll need to pick up where they left off.  The higher-ups really like the dashboard the last team built, but also want to keep track of the staff, and want to know the schedule of each staff.  They should be able to assign a staff member to a dinosaur, or a vendor, as well as the ability to assign equipment to a staff member.  The Chaos Monkey doesn't really appreciate all the micro-management, and has developed more heinous ways to cause trouble.  The higher-ups are starting to understand the impact that introducing a Chaos Monkey has on the park, and has tasked you with creating a system that will alert the park manager when and where the Chaos Monkey strikes.
